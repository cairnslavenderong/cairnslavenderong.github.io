                    <h2>Social behaviour</h2>
                    <h3>Pod Living</h3>
                    <p>Dolphins live in pods, tight-knit groups of 2-30 individuals. In some areas with lots of food,
                        pods can
                        temporarily form superpods of over 100 dolphins.</p>
                    <p>Pods provide protection, cooperative hunting, and childcare.</p>
                    <h3>Social Bonds</h3>
                    <p>Dolphins form long-term relationships, especially between mothers and calves, or between males
                        who form
                        alliances.</p>
                    <p>Social grooming is done through rubbing and swimming in synchrony.</p>
                    <h3>Alliances</h3>
                    <p>Some male dolphins form temporary alliances to control access to females. These alliances can
                        last for
                        decades and involve cooperative behavior, showing deep social intelligence.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="cards" id="bhv2">
                    <img src="./images/bhv2.webp" class="bhvimgs" alt="2 dolphins communicating">
                    <h2>Communication</h2>
                    <h3>Vocalizations</h3>
                    <p>Use clicks, whistles, and burst pulses. Each dolphin has a “signature whistle” that functions
                        like a
                        name.</p>
                    <h3>Echolocation</h3>
                    <p>Clicking sounds are used for echolocation (like sonar) to navigate, hunt, and understand
                        surroundings.
                    </p>
                    <p>Echoes bounce back from objects, helping them judge distance, shape, and size.</p>
                    <h3>Body Language</h3>
                    <p>Use jumps, tail slaps, head butts, and jaw claps and bubbles to communicate emotion or warnings.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="cards" id="bhv3">
                    <img src="./images/bhv3.webp" class="bhvimgs" alt="2 dolphins playing ball">
                    <h2>Cognitive & Play Behaviour</h2>
                    <h3>Playfulness</h3>
                    <p>Dolphins play with other animals, such as turtles or even humans. They surf waves, play with
                        seaweed, and
                        chase each other for fun.</p>
                    <p>Play strengthens social bonds and helps practice hunting or social skills.</p>
                    <h3>Imitation and Problem Solving</h3>
                    <p>Can mimic human behavior or other dolphins, capable of abstract thinking—some trained
                        dolphins can
                        understand symbols, syntax, or even mirror themselves.</p>
                    <h3>Tool Use</h3>
                    <p>Some dolphins (like those in Shark Bay, Australia) use marine sponges on their snouts to
                        protect
                        themselves while foraging on sharp ocean floors.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="cards" id="bhv4">
                    <img src="./images/bhv4.webp" class="bhvimgs" alt="dolphins making a mud ring">
                    <h2>Foraging and Hunting Behaviour</h2>
                    <h3>Cooperative Hunting</h3>
                    <p>Herd fish into tight balls or push them toward shallow waters or nets.</p>
                    <p>In Florida and parts of Africa, dolphins work with humans to drive fish into fishermen's
                        nets—then
                        grab escaping fish.</p>
                    <h3>Mud Ring Feeding</h3>
                    <p>Dolphins create circular plumes of mud to trap fish in a ring, making them leap out of the
                        water—right into waiting dolphin mouths.</p>
                    <h3>Strand Feeding (Rare)</h3>
                    <p>In some places, dolphins beach themselves briefly to snatch fish from the shore—high-risk,
                        learned
                        behavior.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="cards" id="bhv5">
                    <img src="./images/bhv5.webp" class="bhvimgs" alt="2 dolphins swimming together">
                    <h2>Protective and Altruistic Behaviour</h2>
                    <h3>Care for the Sick/Injured</h3>
                    <p>Dolphins support injured pod mates, keeping them at the surface to breathe.</p>
                    <h3>Inter-Species Help</h3>
                    <p>Dolphins have protected swimmers from sharks, or rescuing stranded whales or other marine
                        mammals.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Maternal Care</h3>
                    <p>Calves stay with their mothers for 3-6 years, mothers nurse, protect, and teach calves to hunt
                        and
                        navigate</p>
                </div>

                    <h2>Resting Behaviour</h2>
                    <h3>Unihemispheric Sleep</h3>
                    <p>Dolphins sleep with one half of their brain at a time—the other half stays awake to breathe and
                        watch
                        for danger. They float slowly or swim in a relaxed state during rest.</p>

                    <h2>Self-Awareness and Consciousness</h2>
                    <h3>Mirror Test (Self-Recognition)</h3>
                    <p>What it is: An animal is marked with a spot of paint on its body in a place it can't normally
                        see.
                    </p>
                    <p>When dolphins see themselves in a mirror, they turn their bodies to inspect the mark showing they
                        understand “That's me in the mirror,” not “another dolphin.” Most animals
                        fail this test—only a few species like humans, elephants, apes, and magpies pass it.</p>

                    <h2>Learning, Teaching, and Memory</h2>
                    <h3>Observational Learning</h3>
                    <p>Calves learn how to hunt, how to avoid danger, and how to use tools by watching older dolphins
                        through
                        guiding or demostrating.</p>
                    <h3>Long-Term Memory</h3>
                    <p>Dolphins remember the signature whistles (like names) of others even after 20+ years.</p>
                    <p>Example: A dolphin in captivity recognized a whistle played through a speaker from another
                        dolphin it
                        hadn't seen in decades.</p>

                    <h2>Tool Use and Cultural Transmission</h2>
                    <h3>Sponge-Carrying Dolphins</h3>
                    <p>In Shark Bay, Australia, dolphins have been observed putting sponges over their snouts while
                        searching
                        the seafloor for prey. This protects their skin from sharp coral or rocks. and is passed from
                        mother
                        to
                        daughter like human culture, showing cultural learning, not just instinct. </p>
                    <h2>Problem-Solving and Symbol Understanding</h2>
                    <h3>Complex Training Tasks</h3>
                    <p>Dolphins can understand novel instructions using symbols or gestures and combine multiple
                        commands.
                        They
                        can also follow grammatical order: For example, “Take the hoop to the ball” vs “Take the ball to
                        the
                        hoop.”</p>
                    <h3>Imitation Games</h3>
                    <p>Dolphins can imitate human movements even with different body shapes. They also mimic sounds and
                        dolphin
                        actions without direct sight—suggesting strong auditory processing and memory.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="zigzag" id="intlrow3">
                    <h2>Social Intelligence and Emotion</h2>
                    <h3>Relationships and Alliances</h3>
                    <p>Male dolphins form strategic alliances that last decades to help them access mates, involving
                        trust,
                        negotiation, and cooperation.</p>
                    <h3>Empathy and Altruism</h3>
                    <p>Helping sick pod members reach the surface.</p>
                    <p>Guarding injured dolphins from predators.</p>
                    <p>Even aiding humans and whales in trouble.</p>
                    <h3>Grief and Mourning</h3>
                    <p>Some dolphins carry dead calves or stay with them for hours or days—behavior similar to mourning.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Brain Structure and Size</h2>
                    <h3>Dolphin Brains</h3>
                    <p>Very large brains relative to body size (second only to humans). The neocortex (used for
                        problem-solving
                        and awareness) is highly developed.</p>
                    <p>The limbic system, associated with emotion and social behavior, is also well-developed.</p>
                    <p>The folds in their cortex (gyri and sulci) are more complex than in humans—suggesting dense
                        neural
                        networks for complex thinking.</p>
                    <h3>Playful Behvaiour</h3>
                    <p>Play is seen as a sign of intelligence and boredom avoidance.</p>
                    <h3>Creativity</h3>
                    <p>They create new tricks and variations on learned behaviors in captivity, just to get attention or
                        rewards.</p>

                    <h3>Streamlined Body</h3>
                    <p>Dolphins have a torpedo-shaped body that reduces drag and allows efficient swimming.
                        Their smooth skin also reduces water resistance and heals quickly from scratches.</p>
                    <h3>Dorsal Fin & Flippers</h3>
                    <p>Their back fin helps with balance and stability.
                        The pectoral flippers are used for steering and braking, while the tail fluke propels them
                        forward
                        with
                        strong vertical strokes.</p>
                    <h3>Blubber</h3>
                    <p>A thick layer of fat (blubber) insulates dolphins in cold water.
                        It also serves as an energy reserve when food is scarce.</p>

                    <h3>Speed and Agility</h3>
                    <p>Their speed allows them to escape sharks and orcas.</p>
                    <h3>Group Defense</h3>
                    <p>Pods may surround a sick dolphin or mob a predator to protect themselves.</p>
                    <h3>Camouflage (Counter-Shading)</h3>
                    <p>Dolphins have dark backs and light bellies, making them hard to see from both above and below in
                        the
                        water.</p>

                    <h3>Blowhole</h3>
                    <p>The blowhole on top of their head allows dolphins to breathe without lifting their whole body out
                        of
                        the
                        water. It has a muscular flap that seals it shut underwater to prevent drowning.</p>
                    <h3>Voluntary Breathing</h3>
                    <p>Unlike humans, dolphins consciously control their breathing—they don't breathe automatically.
                        This allows them to dive without inhaling water and stay underwater for several minutes (some up
                        to
                        15-20
                        minutes).</p>

                    <h2>Sensory Adaptations</h2> <!--point 4-->
                    <h3>Echolocation</h3>
                    <p>Dolphins emit clicks through a fatty organ in their forehead (<b>melon</b>).</p>
                    <p>Echoes bounce off objects and return to the dolphin's lower jaw, where vibrations are sent to the
                        brain.
                        Echolocation helps them "see" in the dark, murky water, track prey, and avoid obstacles.</p>
                    <h3>Acute Hearing</h3>
                    <p>Their hearing is extremely sharp and works well both in water and air.</p>
                    <p>They can detect high-frequency sounds beyond the range of human hearing.</p>
                    <h3>Good Vision</h3>
                    <p>Dolphins have excellent underwater vision, and can also see clearly in air thanks to specialized
                        eye
                        muscles.</p>
                    <p>They can detect motion and contrast better than fine details.</p>
                    <h3>Limited Smell, Enhanced Taste</h3>
                    <p>Dolphins have little to no sense of smell, but some species may taste seawater to detect
                        chemicals
                        from
                        prey
                        or other dolphins.</p>

                    <h3>Conical Teeth</h3>
                    <p>Dolphins have conical, pointed teeth suited for grabbing slippery prey, like fish and squid.
                        They swallow prey whole—they don't chew.</p>
                    <h3>Fast, Agile Swimmers</h3>
                    <p>Dolphins can reach bursts of 55 km/h (34 mph) to catch prey or evade predators.
                        Their muscles store myoglobin, allowing them to store oxygen for extended dives.</p>
                    <h3>Cooperative Hunting</h3>
                    <p>In some species, dolphins hunt in teams to herd fish into balls, or drive them toward shallow
                        water.
                        They use mud rings, wave washing, or beaching techniques to trap prey.</p>

                    <h3>Counter-Current Heat Exchange</h3>
                    <p>Blood vessels in the flippers and fins conserve heat by transferring warmth from arteries to
                        nearby
                        veins, helping to maintain core body temperature.</p>
                    <h2>Sleeping Adaptations</h2> <!--point 7-->
                    <h3>Unihemispheric Slow-Wave Sleep</h3>
                    <p>Dolphins sleep by shutting down one hemisphere of their brain at a time.
                        This allows them to stay partially alert, continue swimming, and surface to breathe while
                        resting.

                    <p>Most dolphins have homodont teeth—all the same shape.</p>
                    <h2>Nervous System and Brain</h2> <!--point 2-->
                    <h3>Brain Features</h3>
                    <p>Large, complex brains with a high encephalization quotient (brain-to-body ratio).</p>
                    <p>Highly folded cerebral cortex → suggests advanced thinking.</p>
                    <p>Well-developed limbic system for emotional processing.</p>
                    <h3>Intelligence</h3>
                    <p>Supports self-awareness, problem-solving, memory, learning, and communication.</p>
                    <h2>Sensory Biology</h2> <!--point 3-->
                    <h3>Hearing and Echolocation</h3>
                    <p>Specialized inner ear structures tuned for underwater sound.</p>
                    <p>Use echolocation: produce clicks via the melon, receive echoes through the jawbone.</p>
                    <h3>Vision</h3>
                    <p>Good eyesight in air and water.</p>
                    <p>Adjusts focus via muscles in the lens and cornea.</p>
                    <h3>Touch</h3>
                    <p>Sensitive skin, especially on the rostrum (snout).</p>
                    <p>Use touch for bonding and communication. Nerve endings from sensitive skin can be used to
                        feel/touch
                        objects which is why tame dolphins like to be stroked</p>
                    <p>Their skin is also delicate and easily injured by rough surfaces, fishing nets or by being cut by
                        a
                        sharp
                        fingernail. However, the healing process is quick.</p>
                    <h3>Taste</h3>
                    <p>Can detect salty, sour, and bitter tastes; little or no sense of smell.</p>

                    <h3>Size and Shape</h3>
                    <p>Ranges from 1.5 meters (Maui's dolphin) to over 9 meters (orca).</p>
                    <p>Streamlined, torpedo-shaped bodies for efficient swimming.</p>
                    <p>Pectoral flippers: used for steering.</p>
                    <p>Dorsal fin: stabilizes the body.</p>
                    <p>Tail flukes: generate powerful thrust and also allow them to jump 15 ft in the air.</p>
                    <h3>Skin and Color</h3>
                    <p>Smooth, rubbery skin that shed regularly for hydrodynamic efficiency.</p>
                    <p>Typically counter-shaded: dark back, light belly for camouflage.</p>
                    <h3>Skeleton</h3>
                    <p>Flexible spine for vertical tail movement.</p>
                    <p>Reduced or absent hind limbs (vestigial bones remain).</p>
                    <p>No external ears; sound is received through the lower jaw.</p>
                    <h2>Circulatory and Respiratory Systems</h2> <!--point 5-->
                    <h3>Heart and Circulation</h3>
                    <p>Four-chambered heart (like all mammals).</p>
                    <p>Capable of slowing heart rate during dives (called bradycardia) to conserve oxygen.</p>
                    <h3>Breathing and Blowhole</h3>
                    <p>Dolphins breathe through a single blowhole on top of their head.</p>
                    <p>Voluntary breathers: must consciously come up to breathe.</p>
                    <p>Can hold breath 5-15 minutes, depending on species.</p>
                    <h2>Thermoregulation</h2> <!--point 6-->
                    <p>Dolphins are endothermic (warm-blooded).</p>
                    <p>Blubber helps retain heat in cold water.</p>
                    <p>Countercurrent heat exchange in fins/flippers helps maintain body temperature.</p>

                    <p>Main stomach - digestion.</p>
                    <p>Pyloric stomach - further breakdown.</p>

                    <p>Dolphins reach sexual maturity between 5-15 years, depending on species.</p>
                    <h3>Mating</h3>
                    <p>Mating is seasonal or year-round, depending on environment.</p>
                    <p>Males may form alliances to access females.</p>
                    <h3>Gestation and Birth</h3>
                    <p>Gestation lasts 10-17 months.</p>
                    <p>Usually 1 calf is born tail-first to avoid drowning.</p>
                    <p>Mothers nurse calves for 1-2 years, and stay close for several years for teaching.</p>

                    <p>Dolphins evolved from four-legged land mammals (~50 million years ago).</p>
                    <p>Ancestor: a wolf-like animal called Pakicetus.</p>
                    <p>Over time, hind limbs disappeared, nostrils moved to the top of the head, and forelimbs turned
                        into
                        flippers.</p>
